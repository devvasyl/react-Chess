# ReactJS Chess

A web chess game coded in React. This was my first web development project. Feel free to contribute as this is an open source project!

## How to Play
Click the piece you want to move, and then click the desired destination. Users play against a simple chess engine.

## Features
You play as the white player, and black is controlled by a simple chess engine. Most of the rules of chess, from castling to not being able to put yourself in check, are fully implemented. Draws and time limits are not enabled in this app. I also implemented time travel, so that users can view previous moves.

## Demo
You can play here: [ReactJS Chess](https://arpansahoo.github.io/reactjs-chess/).

v2.0 will have the following: (1) improved chess engine, (2) option to battle friends via the Internet, and (3) chat.
